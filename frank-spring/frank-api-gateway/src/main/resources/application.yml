# application.yml
# Spring Boot application configuration
# -----------------------
# Minimal configuration for Frank-API-Gateway microservice 
#
# NOTES:
# - Reactive web application type is required for Spring Cloud Gateway
# - Basic routing is configured for hello, orchestrator, and SSE services
# - StripPrefix filter used as an example for path modification
# - Autoconfigure.exclude removed as keys are now correct
