# ------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration file for the Payment Card Wrapper Service (Port 18082)
#
# PURPOSE:
# • Defines server-level properties for this Spring Boot WebFlux service.
# • Sets the HTTP server port explicitly to 18082 to avoid conflicts.
#
# NOTES:
# • This service listens for POST requests on /cardpayment/send.
# • Works with the LambdaInvokerService to invoke PaymentCard Lambda
#   running on LocalStack.
# • Keep this port consistent with the Docker container / test-wrapper.sh script.
