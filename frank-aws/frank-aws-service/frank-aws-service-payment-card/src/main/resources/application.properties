# application.properties
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Application configuration for the Frank AWS Payment Card Wrapper Service.
# This file defines the minimal properties needed for the Spring Boot service
# to run correctly and be identified in the ecosystem.
#
# 1. spring.application.name
#    - Sets the logical name of this Spring Boot application.
#    - Used for logging, monitoring, and service discovery.
#    - Helps distinguish this service from other microservices in the Frank AWS stack.
#
# 2. server.port
#    - Defines the port the embedded server listens on.
#    - Port 18082 is dedicated for the Payment Card Producer Wrapper Service.
#
# Notes:
# - Additional properties like logging levels, AWS integration details, or
#   security settings can be added here in the future.
