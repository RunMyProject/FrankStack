/*
 * ==========================================================
 * Spring Boot Test Class (NOT REQUIRED/APPLICABLE)
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * This class uses Spring Boot testing annotations (@SpringBootTest)
 * which are designed for integration tests within a full Spring 
 * application context.
 * * Since this project is a native AWS Lambda deployed without 
 * the Spring framework overhead:
 * 1. Testing should focus on standard JUnit unit tests.
 * 2. Integration testing (like publishing to SNS) is performed 
 * via external tools (AWS CLI/LocalStack) rather than a 
 * Spring-managed test harness.
 * 3. This test class is not needed and can be safely ignored 
 * or removed from the project structure.
